I'm a software engineer that is eager to learn and understand new concepts and ideas through collaborating with others, project development, all while building a community with fellow people in Tech, building a support network for those navigating through the tech industry and let my journey be a story of inspiration and motivation for others who have been feeling lost during their journey. Some technologies I enjoy working with are currently  HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a goal of becoming proficient with React, Python and SQL.

This GitHub is to display my journey into tech. As I learn technology, my goal is to make progressive steps into becoming a proficient developer that can contribute to society through my programming abilities. I know that the road before me is very long and that it will take me a while to get there, but I know I will see the end of it.
